## Overview

### Create a Schema 

First, we need to create a schema using the Schema constructor or simply run ```sh node ./node_modules/clev-cqrs/src/createTemplate``` from clev-cqrs, the schema should look something like this

```js
let   clevCqrs = require("clev-cqrs");
const ExampleView2 = require("../views/ExampleView2");
const ExampleView = require("../views/ExampleView");
const eventStore = require("../eventstore/eventstore");
let SchemaName = new clevCqrs.Schema({
  schemaName: "schemaName e.g Product",
  fields: {
    //fields here
    //    e.g   name:{
    //          type:'string',
    //          required:true
    //          },
  },
  commandHandlers: {
    //handleCreate command handler is required
    handleCreate: function (changesObject, currentData) {
      currentData = changesObject.id; //required
      // add other entity details here using example of this format
      // currentData.description=  changesObject.description
      // currentData.name = changesObject.name
    },

    // other command handlers here e.g
    // handleChangeName: function(changesObject, currentData){
    //     currentData.name= changesObject.name
    // },
  },
  eventStore: {
    methods: {
      get: eventStore.get,
      delete: eventStore.delete,
      getAll: eventStore.getAll,
      save: eventStore.save,
    },
  },
  eventHandlers: {
    views: [ExampleView, ExampleView2],
  },
});

clevCqrs.setSchema(SchemaName);
```

Your schema should contain the following

### schemaName `string`

This should be the name of your business entity e.g Product, User e.t.c

### fields `object`

This should contain all the property of the entity, each property should have its own `type` and `required` field e.g

```js
    fields: {
        name:{
         type:'string',// all types would be discussed later on this page
         required:true // can also be false
        },

    },
```

### commandHandlers `object`

commandHandlers are mearnt to handle any change that happens to your entity e.g(change of name, price, age and so on), each handler points to a function that takes in two parameters, 1. `changesObject` An object with the changes you made e.g {name:'Roberto Callus'} you can then set the changes to your currentData as shown in the code below and 2. `currentData` which is the current state of your entity. 

**Note** that the `handleCreate` command handler is required as this would be used to create your entity and don't forget to set the id property(id would be autogenerated you don't need to border about it just set it that's all). Also every command handler must start with the word `handle` e.g `handleDebitWallet`, `handleShipOrder` and every handler is mearnt to handle a change in each property i.e ***handleChangeName*** should only handle change of name, ***handleUpdateAge*** should only handle change of age e.t.c

```js
    commandHandlers: {
        //handleCreate command handler is required
        //every command handler must start with the word handle
        handleCreate: function (changesObject, currentData) {
            currentData.id = changesObject.id //required
            // add other entity details here using example of this format
            // currentData.description= changesObject.description
            // currentData.name = changesObject.name
        },

        // examples of command handlers
        handleChangeName: function(changesObject, currentData){
            currentData.name= changesObject.name
        },
        handleDebitWallet: function(changesObject, currentData){
            currentData.wallet = currentData.wallet - changesObject.wallet
        },

        //....

    }

```

### eventStore `object`

eventStore is an object that points to methods. There are four methods that must be provided
`get`, `getAll`, `delete` and `save`. The `get` property should be set to an asynchronous function that takes in an id, search for an object from your database with the id and return it. The `getAll` property should be set to an asynchronous function that returns all the documents in your database as an array. The `delete` property should be set to an asynchronous function that takes in an id and delete a document based on the id that was passed. The `save` property should be set to a function that saves a object to your database. e.g

```js
//if you are using a mongo db
    eventStore: {
            methods: {
                        get: async function (id) {
                            let event = await db.collection('events').findOne({ id })
                            return event
                        },
                        delete: async function (id) {
                              await db.collection('events').deleteOne({ id })
                        },
                        getAll: async function () {

                            let events = await db.collection('events').find({})
                            let eventsToArray = await events.toArray()
                            return eventsToArray
                        },
                        save: async function (event) {
                           await db.collection('events').insertOne(event)

                        }
        }
    },
```

### eventHandlers `object`

event handlers is an object that points to different views that you want in your service.

```js
eventHandlers: {
  views: [ExampleView, ExampleView2];
}
```

### views `object`

views are various ways you want see your data represented, for example if you are working on an e-commerce service, you can have a view that displays all the order that has been placed so far (`ordersView`) and another view that displays the customer that has placed the highest number of orders(`cutomerPeformanceView`). Each view respond to events that concerns it, lets use the example above, each order would have properties like
`orderPlacedBy`, `items`,`totalPrice`, `shippingAddress`, `totalQuantity`. When the `shippingAddress` is updated, only the `ordersView` would be affected but if the `orderPlacedBy` was updated both the `ordersView` and the `cutomerPeformanceView` would be updated.

###

To create a view, create an instance of the clevCqrs.View then execute the setHandlers method. the setHandlers method takes in an object parameter, this object would have the handlers for any change that happens, each handler is a function that takes in two parameters, `1` an object representing the change that was made e.g ``{age : 20}` . `2` `callback` this should always be called after an event is handled to show that no error occured, you can pass an error to it, it would be thrown if it occurs. 


**Note** that eventHandlers in a view must use thesame name that was used for the commandHandler e.g `handleChangeName` , `handleChangeAddress` and so on. Each view must have a handleCreate event handler as this would be used to create the entity don't forget to set the id property on the entity while creating. An example of a view is shown below

```js

//Assuming you are using a mongo database
const clevCqrs = require("clev-cqrs");
let ProductDetailsView = new clevCqrs.View();
//set handler for any event any event that is related to this view, this should relate to changes you want to make to the read database
// for example if this a ProductDetails view you might want to check for events that affect all attribute of the product and if it's a ProductPrice view you might want to check for event that affect only name and price attribute
ProductDetailsView.setHandlers({
  handleCreate: async function (product, callback) {
    let itemToAddTODB = {
      id: product.id, // required
      name: product.name,
      description: product.description,
      size: product.size,
      price: 2000,
    };
    // add itemToAddTODB to database

   db.collection("products").insertOne(itemToAddTODB).then(()=>{
       callback(null)
   })
   .catch((err)=>{
       callback(err);
   })
    // return a callback to show there are no errors  -required-
    // required
  },


  // add other event handlers here for example
  handleChangeName: async function (product, callback) {
    // update database
    await db.collections("products").updateOne({ id: product.id }, {$set:{name:product.name}}).then(()=>{
       callback(null)
   })
   .catch((err)=>{
       callback(err);
   })
  },


    handleChangePrice: async function (product, callback) {
    // update database
    await db.collections("products").updateOne({ id: product.id }, {$set:{price:product.price}}).then(()=>{
       callback(null)
   })
   .catch((err)=>{
       callback(err);
   })
  },
});

module.exports = ExampleView2;
```



### setSchema method

once you are done creating the schema which include all the proprties explained above jist call the setSchema function passing the schema that you created

```js
clevCqrs.setSchema(SchemaName);
```

# sending a command
After you have created a schema and set it, the steps remaining are very few. Call the module where you created your schema in your root module e.g (app.js or index.js) by using the require function. You can send commands by using the clevCQRS.handler object. The format is clevCQRS.handler. `command handlers name e.g handleCreate or handleChangeName`. The commandHandler that you provided in your schema would be used here. Note that every command handler apart from the handleCreate takes in an id `string`, command `object` and callback function,the id is the id of document that you want to change , command would take in the name of the attribute that you want to change and the new value you want it to be, and the callback would be a function the returns the updated entity and  all the previous events that has ever occured to that entity. e.g

```js

let express = require('express')
const app = express()
require('./schema')
const clevCqrs = require('clev-cqrs')
app.use(clevCqrs.generatePage)

app.post('/create', (req,res)=>{
    let command = {
        name:req.body.name,
        description:req.body.description,
        price:req.body.price,
        size:req.body.size
   }
   clevCqrs.handler.handleCreate(command,function(updatedevent){
    res.send({created: updatedevent.id})
   })
   
    
    
})

app.post('/description/:id', (req,res)=>{
    let command = {
        description:req.body.description,
    }
    clevCqrs.handler.handleChangeDescription(req.params.id, command,function(updatedevent){
     if(event){
        res.send({done:updatedevent})
     }
    })
  
})

```


## eventstore page

clev-cqrs provides a nice user interface to view all the events that has occured to your data. This include the event id, the event type e.g(changeName), the event time and the event data. to generatge this page just add the clevCQRS.generatePage as a middleware. e.g
```js
const clevCqrs = require('clev-cqrs')
app.use(clevCqrs.generatePage)
```
It looks like this

## Types in clev-cqrs
clev-Cqrs support various types which are
 * string
 * number
 * buffer
 * date
 * mix
 * object
 * array

The types are used when contructing your schema. An example of how to use the types is in the code below

```js
let   clevCqrs = require("clev-cqrs");
const ExampleView2 = require("../views/ExampleView2");
const ExampleView = require("../views/ExampleView");
const eventStore = require("../eventstore/eventstore");
let SchemaName = new clevCqrs.Schema({
  schemaName: "User",
   fields: {

    name: {
      type: 'string',
      required: true
    },
    age: {
      max: 100,
      min: 1,
      type: 'number'
    },
    nameToBuffer: {
      type: 'buffer'
    },
    dob: {
      type: 'date',
      required: false
    },
    mixed: {
      type: 'mix'
    },
    address: {
      type: 'object'
    },
    roles: {
      type: 'array'
    }

  },
 


 //.........
});

clevCqrs.setSchema(SchemaName);


```
You can set the **min** and **max** value if the data type is a number as shown in the code above and you can also make a field required or not.

### Here is an example of a command with all the clev-cqrs data types
```js
let command = {
      name: 1,//number type
      address: { //object type
        town: 'ado'
      },
      roles: [1, 2],//array type
      mixed: '1234',// mixed sample
      dob: 123, // date type
      nameToBuffer: new Buffer.alloc(1, 2),// buffer type
}

app.post('/create', (req,res)=>{
   clevCqrs.handler.handleCreate(command,function(newEvent){
    res.status(201).send({created: newEvent.id})
   }) 
})

```
