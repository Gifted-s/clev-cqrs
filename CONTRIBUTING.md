### Reporting bugs

- Before opening a new issue, look for existing [issues](https://github.com/Gifted-s/clev-cqrs/issues) to avoid duplication or no response. If the issue does not yet exist, [create one](https://github.com/Gifted-s/clev-cqrs/issues/new).
  - Please add any relevant code samples, preferably a standalone script that
  reproduces your issue. Describe all your issue fully and not abstract, show your
  code.
  - If the bug involves an error, please post the stack trace.
  - Please post the version of clev-cqrs that you're using.
 Â - Please write bug reports in JavaScript (ES5, ES6, etc) that runs in Node.js, not coffeescript, typescript, etc.

### Requesting new features

- Please describe a use case for it
- it would be ideal to include test cases as well

### Fixing bugs / Adding features

- Before starting to write code, look for existing [issues](https://github.com/Gifted-s/clev-cqrs/issues). That way you avoid working on something that might not be of interest or that has been addressed already in a different branch. You can create a new issue [here](https://github.com/Gifted-s/clev-cqrs/issuess/new).
  - _The source of this project is written in javascript, not coffeescript or typescript. Please write your bug reports in JavaScript that can run in vanilla Node.js_.
- Fork the [repo](https://github.com/Gifted-s/clev-cqrs).
- Follow the general coding style of the rest of the project:
  - 2 space tabs
  - no trailing whitespace
  - 1 space between conditionals, no space before function parenthesis
    - `if (..) {`
    - `for (..) {`
    - `while (..) {`
    - `function(err) {`
- Write tests and make sure they pass (tests are in the [test](https://github.com/Gifted-s/clev-cqrs/tree/master/__test__/tests) directory).

### Running the tests
- Open a terminal and navigate to the root of the project
- execute `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies
- Make the index.js file listen to a particular port.
- execute `npm test` to run the tests (we're using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/))
